# Introduction: 
Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, 
and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite 
supply of one of the three ingredients â€” one smoker has an infinite supply of 
tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matched. 
There is also a non-smoking agent that enables the smokers to make their 
cigarettes by arbitrarily (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to 
place on the table. The smoker with the third supply should remove the two items 
from the table, using them (along with their own) to make a cigarette, which they 
smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two 
new random items on the table. This process continues forever. 
Three semaphores are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases 
the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and 
smokers decrement 
the semaphore when 
removing items. 
Also, each smoker 
has an associated 
semaphore that they 
use to signal to the 
agent that the 
smoker is done 
smoking; the agent 
has a process that 
waits on each 
smoker's semaphore 
to let the agent know 
that it can place the new items on the table.   
Background: 
In the background we have 3 threads (smokers) one for each smoker, each smoker 
has one of the 3 ingredients tobacco, match, and paper, each smoker will require 
the 2 other ingredients to achieve a critical section (smoke). Here we get the agent; 
the agent contains all three resources and will randomly pick two ingredients and 
present them to the smokers. Many unique situations can be derived from it. 
For example, the agent presents the smokers with Tobacco and Match and 
the only way for this scenario to work out is for the smoker with the paper must 
comfortable and form a cigarette to smoke if any other smoker comes worth with 
the wrong ingredients, we will enter into a state of Deadlock, to avoid this 
condition we have put forward our solution and its implementation. 
Each Smoker will have an infinite supply of the ingredient (Tobacco, Paper, 
and Match) it has, and the agent will have an infinite supply of all three 
ingredients. Still, it has to randomly present the ingredient to the smokers (threads) 
so that they may function. 
# Objective: 
We, the students of Computer Science, are the future of the next 
technological revolution. We are living in an era, where Technology is changing so 
fast that, it is hard to keep track of. However, behind every modern-day tech, there 
is a major role in algorithm design. No tech can prevail in this era without a solid 
algorithm design.  
The operating system is a very vast sea of algorithms and designs, and in this, 
there are numerous opportunities to practice and implement algorithms. Keeping 
all these things in sight, we decided to work on the chain smoker problem because 
of the beautiful question it possesses for synchronization. 
The objective of this project was to understand the synchronization problem 
proposed by the author to build a solution that can solve the problem, gain 
experience from the implementation, and use it as a stepping-stone for future 
projects. 
# Result: 
The Deadlock condition between the smokers can be avoided and resolved 
by using three semaphores. To design the complete solution, we use four threads to 
simulate Agent, Smoker with an infinite supply of Tobacco, Smoker with an 
infinite supply of matchsticks, and Smoker with an infinite supply of paper.  
The agent thread will be used to unlock any two random semaphores 
(putting items on the table). In that brief time, the smoker thread, which has a third 
ingredient, will enter the critical, section and will execute (according to the 
problem he will make and then smoke the cigarette). 
This project made us understand the complexity of deadlock and how to 
avoid them, for in the years to come the world is developing, and in order to avoid 
differences and achieve maximizing the chances of our success we had to bring forth steps of 
change, change in syntax, change in    
Platform: 
While working on a project it is necessary to know what Platform will be 
most aligned to help out or work out for your project The Platform on which this 
project was performed was Ubuntu 22.04.1 and the Linux kernel version was 
Linux-4.19.282. We used A Virtual Box to use Ubuntu 22.04.1 and did our project 
on it. 
This project is of such a type that it cannot be Platform independent and we 
had to decide its parameters and take into consideration carefully its minute 
requirements to increase the chance of our success. 
# Languages: 
As the project was done on the kernel level the language we used was C, and 
researched some other functions and libraries of the C-Language to help us in 
successfully executing our program, for example, in this project pthreads and 
semaphores were very useful, and used a lot. Slight differences occurred as this 
project involved a system call and we had to make severe changes to achieve the 
desired syntax used in a system call, we had to keep in mind that many things that 
are part of a normal C program will not be used in the same way in the kernel 
programming because it requires different syntax for it to function properly.  
# Methodologies: 
As for the successful implementation of our project, we used Pthreads and 
Semaphores for the synchronization of the code. We tried to do our code with just 
one system call, but it was not adding up, so we had to introduce 3 separate system 
calls to ensure the correct working of the code.  For the help on System call, we 
used this manual available to us online: 
https://dev.to/jasper/adding-a-system-call-to-the-linux-kernel-5-8-1-in-ubuntu-20-04-lts-2ga8 . 
We had to follow these instructions because we were using the latest version of Ubuntu and there 
were not so many guidelines for system calls to run on it. These proved very helpful and proved 
rather useful in our journey to accomplish the task. 

# Conclusion: 
Because of hard work and good coordination between the team members, not 
only did we manage to solve the chain smoker problem Furthermore, but we also 
added three system calls (for all three Smokers) in the Linux kernel Linux
4.19.282 to make the solution interactive and easy to understand, the purpose of 
this build will be to show the interactivity of the semaphores and threads so that to 
avoid a circumstance which could lead to a deadlock and waste all of our valuable 
resources., It will professionally guide the code/ program to avoid deadlocks and 
ensure the smooth running of the code that each section will run smoothly.
